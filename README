This is sample code to practice mutation testing code on

== Description for running exemplor-chaser:

Once you've installed exemplor-chaser, the first command below should indicate that
the code isn't fully described (MyMath#times can be mutated and the example doesn't fail),
while the second command should indicate that the code is fully described (all mutations
cause at least one example to fail).

exemplor-chaser MyMath --verbose --test partial_examples.rb
exemplor-chaser MyMath --verbose --test full_examples.rb

== Description for running zombie-chaser:

There are three test/unit scenarios to be run. One contains a broken test, which'll
kill the human. The second one has passing tests, but doesn't fully the code being
tested, so not all of the zombies will be killed. The third one fully tests the code,
meaning that all of the zombies will be killed.
