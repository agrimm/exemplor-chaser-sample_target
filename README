== Description:

This is sample code to practice exemplor-chaser on.

Once you've installed exemplor-chaser, the first command below should indicate that
the code isn't fully described (MyMath#times can be mutated and the example doesn't fail),
while the second command should indicate that the code is fully described (all mutations
cause at least one example to fail).

exemplor-chaser MyMath --verbose --test partial_examples.rb
exemplor-chaser MyMath --verbose --test full_examples.rb
